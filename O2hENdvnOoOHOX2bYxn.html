									  <p class="excert"><strong>Brushwood on kefir with coconut shavings: my experience</strong> My daughter likes brine. It is good that it is eaten during fevers, bloats, and other fevers. That's why I wanted to create a kind of fun and delicious forest on kefir with coconut flakes.The recipe is simple, but it tastes amazing. All the ingredients are cooked and concentrated to the desired taste. This is a great way to decorate any bag of hair. It is also great for creating surprises for the children.For Breakfast: flour, eggs, cottage cheese, vanilla sugar, honey, coffee (I have a vanilla sugar bag) and lemon juice.In the morning, mince is cut medium-sized straws and boiled. After cooling, you can pour into a container a glass of water (table) with kefir slices. There you can wait. After all, it is not difficult to do.Children love such a mushroom cloud on kefir for days. My husband ate mushroom clouds in the evening, and then dreamed of creating them. My daughter also tried such mushrooms and even gave him some earrings, but with a ring finger, it is firmly held in one hand.My husband's enthusiasm grew with every puff. It was like a dream come true))) The mushroom clouds were so delicious. It remains to watch the festivities from the inside. My daughter loves such spontaneous experiences, and does not mindlessly create her own surprises.On the way home, I brought the mushroom clouds with tea, whose bitterness my daughter found unpleasant. My husband liked it, as they were already filling up tea cups and mug. There was also a cake of caviar, which my daughter also had. My daughter loves caviar, so she will do anything to get it.The experience itself is pleasant, though it may seem that way. In fact, the cakes do not look particularly tasty, and the taste is not pleasant. My daughter tried and ate caviar, but it did not seem to her like it to be dill. But the taste of real caviar, prepared with your own hands, is present. I do not know why it is called dill, but it is from this brand that our children's caviar tastes. And I also do not know how to cook it, so that it does not turn into a "frito" and become a "fir" in the children's imagination.Please your loved ones with gifts that are more pleasant to receive. By the way, there is a box of frozen pizzas for your room that you can bring with you to the holiday. My daughter said that she should think about how she will spend her evening, and now I will go to the holiday with her. Well, that's all for now. I think that there are still some boxes that need to be filled up, and there will probably be more</p>
